Thrown together prototype for a budgeting tool.  
My bank lets me export transactions as a csv.  
Put two csv's (from both my bank accounts) into input_csvs folder (two is hardcoded - again, thrown together)  
run update_from_input.py - this will modify buckets.json based off the input csvs  
Templates for what my bank csvs look like (history_template.csv) and what buckets.json should look like 
(buckets_template.json) are provided. Modify to suit your preferences but the code will likely need to be 
modified as well. (Again, this is very thrown together atm).
